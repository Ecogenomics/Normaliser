How to write your own format files:

Each format file consists of six parts

1. The first line must contain a single character, which is the separator used in this file
2. All lines following this line, up until the first blank line,describe the format of the header line
   Each line consists of either a single I', 'D' or 'S'.

           'I' specifies that a row/column should be ignored
           'D' specifies that a row/column is the descriptor (primary key) - there can only be one primary descriptor per row/column
           'S' specifies that a row/column contains a secondary descriptor - there can be multiple secondary descriptors

3. A single blank line. This tells the software that the next line will be the data line
4. The data line consists of any combination of the characters 'I',  'D', 'S' and 'M'.
   Characters are separated by commas.

           'M' specifies that this column contains data. So are all lines up until either an, I, S, D or the end of the line.

5. A single blank line. This tells the software that the next line describes the order [site vs species or vice versa.]
6. Consists of either the sole word "PN" or the sole word "NP"

For example, with qiime output. This says to ignore the first line of the file, the second line is the header
Data follows in the form of species by site and the descriptors are at the start and end of the lines

--start--
	
I
D

D,M,S

NP
--end--
